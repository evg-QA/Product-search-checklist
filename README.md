Task:

A detailed checklist of the functionality of product search by parameters:
- name
- selling price
- unit of measurement.


Recommendations for implementation:
- it is not necessary to formulate and spell out the expected result, it is enough to list the checks themselves in a checklist format
- if some requirement is not explicitly stated, we consider that there are no limitations
- if there is insufficient information on the functionality, you can make an assumption.
